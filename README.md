Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile, it's very nice seeing you here.
I have a few things to mention before we move on,
I come from a robotics background where I have worked on remarkable projects, using technology like embedded systems, to IoT.
One of the best projects that I spearheaded was my graduation year project for B>Tech on the topic of Hydroponics farming, where I created an automated model for a complete hydroponics setup
